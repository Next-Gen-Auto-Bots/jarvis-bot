# Jarvis Bot 🤖

Unapologetically enterprise-grade. Jarvis Bot is a production-tuned, security-first automation assistant for Telegram that delivers ultra-fast CI/CD guardrails, least-privilege orchestration, and resilience-by-default. Built for regulated teams, audited environments, and high-velocity DevOps.

## ✨ What’s New — Enterprise Power, Without the Drag
- Lightning-fast CI/CD guardrails with pre-merge policy checks, signed artifacts, and environment protections
- Automated least-privilege service permissions, rotated secrets, and ephemeral credentials
- Multi-provider communications stack (telephony + SMS) with policy-aware routing and fallbacks
- AI-powered intent and routing with explainability logs and red-teamable prompts
- Self-healing runtime with circuit breakers, rate-limiters, and idempotent retries

## 🚀 Quick Start
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Telegram Bot Token
- Provider credentials (e.g., Twilio/Textbelt) stored as environment secrets

### Install
```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Next-Gen-Auto-Bots/jarvis-bot.git
cd jarvis-bot

# Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Fill .env with tokens (do not commit!)

# Run
python bot/main.py
```

### Environment
Create a .env file with required tokens and provider configuration. Never commit secrets—use your vault/CI secret store in non-dev environments.

## 🔐 Security & Compliance by Design
Security isn’t a feature here—it’s the architecture.

- Zero-trust posture: default‑deny policies, explicit allowlists, and scoped execution contexts
- Least privilege automation: granular RBAC for commands, handlers, jobs, and integrations
- Ephemeral credentials: time-bound, rotation-friendly tokens with short TTLs by default
- Secret hygiene: no hardcoded secrets, .env templating, pluggable secret managers (Vault/AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Artifact integrity: checksum + provenance verification, optional Sigstore/GitHub OIDC signing
- Policy-as-code: Enforce org rules pre-commit, pre-merge, and pre-deploy (OPA/Rego ready)
- Data protection: PII-safe logs, structured redaction, and provider-scoped data minimization
- Audit-first: immutable, structured audit trails with correlation IDs and replay-safe events
- Threat modeling: secure defaults for SSRF, injection, abuse, and prompt hardening
- Compliance alignment: SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA-ready patterns; evidence-friendly logging

## 🛡️ CI/CD Guardrails that Move at Your Speed
- Protected branches with required checks and policy gates
- Mandatory code scanning and dependency audits before promoting artifacts
- Environment promotions via signed releases and verified provenance
- Drift detection for permissions and infrastructure policy violations
- Rollback confidence: versioned configs, safe deploys, and automated canaries

## 🎛️ Permissions & Access Controls
- Role-scoped commands (admin, operator, auditor, viewer)
- Command-level allow/deny with context (chat, user, time, environment)
- Provider scoping per environment (dev/stage/prod isolation)
- Just-in-time elevation with auditable approval flows

## 📞 Core Capabilities
- Voice calling: telephony actions with policy-aware execution
- Multi-provider SMS: Textbelt, Twilio, and extensible gateways with failover
- AI intent recognition: contextual understanding with deterministic guardrails
- Multilingual UX: localized /start and responses for global teams
- Advanced Q&A: grounded, explainable answers with optional retrieval

## 🏗️ Architecture
- Modular handlers with clean boundaries and dependency inversion
- Resilience layer: retries, backoff, timeouts, and circuit breakers
- Structured logging with correlation IDs and JSON outputs for SIEMs
- Horizontal scalability and stateless workers; ready for containers/serverless

## 📊 Observability
- Metrics, traces, and structured logs for every critical path
- Health endpoints and readiness checks for orchestrators
- Security events exported to SIEM/SOAR pipelines

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- Unit and contract tests for handlers and providers
- Policy tests for permissions and CI/CD rules
- Chaos/resilience tests for timeouts, rate limits, and provider failures

## 🛠️ Development
```bash
# Lint + type check
ruff check . && mypy .

# Run tests
pytest -q

# Security scan
pip-audit && bandit -r .
```
