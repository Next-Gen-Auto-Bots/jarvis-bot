# Jarvis Bot 🤖

Unapologetically enterprise-grade. Jarvis Bot is a production-tuned, security-first automation assistant for Telegram that delivers ultra-fast CI/CD guardrails, least-privilege orchestration, and resilience-by-default. Built for regulated teams, audited environments, and high-velocity DevOps.

## ✨ What's New — Enterprise Power, Without the Drag

- Lightning-fast CI/CD guardrails with pre-merge policy checks, signed artifacts, and environment protections
- Automated least-privilege service permissions, rotated secrets, and ephemeral credentials
- Multi-provider communications stack (telephony + SMS) with policy-aware routing and fallbacks
- AI-powered intent and routing with explainability logs and red-teamable prompts
- Self-healing runtime with circuit breakers, rate-limiters, and idempotent retries

## 🔒 Decentralized & Private Network Power

**Privacy-first communications that can't be censored, intercepted, or shut down.**

Jarvis Bot now harnesses the full power of decentralized networks to deliver ultra-private, censorship-resistant communications that operate beyond traditional network boundaries:

- **🧅 Tor Network & Onion Routing Integration**: All communications can be routed through the Tor network with military-grade onion routing for maximum anonymity and censorship resistance. Your messages bounce through multiple encrypted relays, making surveillance and interception virtually impossible.

- **🔗 Matrix Protocol & Element Messaging**: Built-in Matrix homeserver connectivity with Element client integration for federated, end-to-end encrypted messaging and voice/video calling. Communicate across the global Matrix network with zero dependency on centralized services.

- **🛡️ Ultra-Private Communications Stack**: Every message, call, and data transfer is protected by multiple layers of encryption:
  - End-to-end encrypted Matrix messaging with perfect forward secrecy
  - Tor-routed traffic with triple-layer onion encryption
  - Ephemeral sessions with automatic key rotation
  - Zero-knowledge architecture—we can't see your data even if we wanted to

- **🌍 Global Censorship-Resistant Operations**: Deploy anywhere, communicate everywhere:
  - Tor hidden services for completely private bot access
  - Matrix federation enables global reach without single points of failure
  - Automatic bridge discovery and relay switching
  - Works even in heavily censored networks and authoritarian regimes

- **⚡ Secure Comms Synergy**: The perfect marriage of privacy, security, and modern communications:
  - Voice calls through Matrix with Tor transport layer
  - Encrypted group messaging with decentralized user discovery
  - File sharing via IPFS with Tor gateway integration
  - Anonymous identity management with cryptographic verification

**This isn't just privacy—this is digital sovereignty. Your communications, your rules, your network.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Telegram Bot Token
- Provider credentials (e.g., Twilio/Textbelt) stored as environment secrets

### Install

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Next-Gen-Auto-Bots/jarvis-bot.git
cd jarvis-bot

# Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env

# Fill .env with tokens (do not commit!)

# Run
python bot/main.py
```

### Environment

Create a .env file with required tokens and provider configuration. Never commit secrets—use your vault/CI secret store in non-dev environments.

## 🔐 Security & Compliance by Design

Security isn't a feature here—it's the architecture.

- Zero-trust posture: default‑deny policies, explicit allowlists, and scoped execution contexts
- Least privilege automation: granular RBAC for commands, handlers, jobs, and integrations
- Ephemeral credentials: time-bound, rotation-friendly tokens with short TTLs by default
- Secret hygiene: no hardcoded secrets, .env templating, pluggable secret managers (Vault/AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Artifact integrity: checksum + provenance verification, optional Sigstore/GitHub OIDC signing
- Policy-as-code: Enforce org rules pre-commit, pre-merge, and pre-deploy (OPA/Rego ready)
- Data protection: PII-safe logs, structured redaction, and provider-scoped data minimization
- Audit-first: immutable, structured audit trails with correlation IDs and replay-safe events
- Threat modeling: secure defaults for SSRF, injection, abuse, and prompt hardening
- Compliance alignment: SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA-ready patterns; evidence-friendly logging

## 🛡️ CI/CD Guardrails that Move at Your Speed

- Protected branches with required checks and policy gates
- Mandatory code scanning and dependency audits before promoting artifacts
- Environment promotions via signed releases and verified provenance
- Drift detection for permissions and infrastructure policy violations
- Rollback confidence: versioned configs, safe deploys, and automated canaries

## 🎛️ Permissions & Access Controls

- Role-scoped commands (admin, operator, auditor, viewer)
- Command-level allow/deny with context (chat, user, time, environment)
- Provider scoping per environment (dev/stage/prod isolation)
- Just-in-time elevation with auditable approval flows

## 📞 Core Capabilities

- Voice calling: telephony actions with policy-aware execution
- Multi-provider SMS: Textbelt, Twilio, and extensible gateways with failover
- AI intent recognition: contextual understanding with deterministic guardrails
- Multilingual UX: localized /start and responses for global teams
- Advanced Q&A: grounded, explainable answers with optional retrieval

## 🏗️ Architecture

- Modular handlers with clean boundaries and dependency inversion
- Resilience layer: retries, backoff, timeouts, and circuit breakers
- Structured logging with correlation IDs and JSON outputs for SIEMs
- Horizontal scalability and stateless workers; ready for containers/serverless

## 📊 Observability

- Metrics, traces, and structured logs for every critical path
- Health endpoints and readiness checks for orchestrators
- Security events exported to SIEM/SOAR pipelines

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- Unit and contract tests for handlers and providers
- Policy tests for permissions and CI/CD rules
- Chaos/resilience tests for timeouts, rate limits, and provider failures

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Lint + type check
ruff check . && mypy .

# Run tests
pytest -q

# Security scan
pip-audit && bandit -r .
```
